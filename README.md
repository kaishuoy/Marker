# Marker
Marker helper for diffing jar files
DESCRIPTION:
Use this to compare a student's jar file to the original one and find what they have written

HOW TO USE:
download the original assignment jar file and put it in the same folder as Marker.jar and the student's 
submission then in console run
java -jar Marker.jar [original zip name] [student zip name]

eg
java -jar Marker.jar master.jar yangkais221A2.jar

Output shows everything the student has changed from the original. Ps it helps to rename the original 
something easy to type(eg master.jar)
